## What is this project?
This project is my solution of [Bike Sharing Demand](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-demand) competition hosted by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com) My solution includes using a variety of different approaches including KNN, SVM, DNN RRF,GBR.
## What are the dependencies for this project?
* sklearn(for knn,svm,rrf,gbm models)
* Keras(for keras dnn model)
* PyTorch(for PyTorch dnn model)
